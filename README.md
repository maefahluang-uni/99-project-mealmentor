## Project instruction
From project now, There're 2 branches of source code in git project.One is the part of application 
interface with feature importing food photo from users will be transfered to another one branch that
stored source code of Ai image classification system that was developed on Python.And how our image 
classification working is input food images dataset then embedding value from image data transformed
to vector value and classify the metadata,training model to process image classification afterward
then stored at vector datastores.When application interface imported food image,it's also embedded
to vectorthen query with vector datastores to detected and assigned what's the imported image from 
application.
